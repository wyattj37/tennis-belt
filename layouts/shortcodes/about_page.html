    <div class="faq-question">What is the Tennis Belt?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      The belt is a way of tracking who is the current champion of tennis as a matter of direct succession. You beat the current champion, you get the belt. Someone then beats you, they get the belt.
      It's definitely not a good measure of who the best tennis player is at any given moment. Or at least not as good as other meaures, like 
      <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles/live">ATP Rankings</a> or <a href="https://tennisabstract.com/reports/atp_elo_ratings.html">ELO</a>. Over time, though,
      as you can see on the <a href="/stats">stats</a> page, the best players do spend more time with the belt. You could argue there's some value
      for comparing overall careers between generations. More importantly, though, it's just sorta fun to track.

    <div class="faq-question">Where does the belt start?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      An interesting question. The <a href="https://github.com/Tennismylife/TML-Database">data</a> I use starts in 1968, which is the year
      that marks the beginning of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/What-Is-the-Open-Era-in-Tennis">Open Era</a>. If you keep up much with tennis,
      you'll know that most tennis records or history is kept track of "in the Open Era". It's similar to the way that people tend to start basketball stats after 
      the ABA–NBA merger or football stats after the first Super Bowl.
      <br><br>
      Therefore, I opted for the first holder of the belt to be the first tournament winner in the Open Era. The tournament was the 
      1968 British Hard Court Championships and the winner was Aussie Ken Rosewall. Because of the format of tennis, it doesn't actually matter
      much where you start, since all paths will converge relatively quickly. More on that in the next section.

    <div class="faq-question">On the tournament nature of tennis...</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      The difference between tennis and college football which massively changes the flow of the belt is the prevalence of tournaments. Clearly, if any belt-holder enters a tournament, the belt will ultimately find its way to the winner of the tournament. Whereas the ATP Tour is effectively a yearlong series of tournaments, in college football there is only one tournament at the end of the year, the College Football Playoff. Even so, there’s no guarantee that the belt will appear in the CFP. It’s reasonable to guess teams in the playoff are somewhat more likely to have the belt at the end of the year, as they have been winning more games than other teams, however there have been plenty of seasons where this was not the case.
      <br><br>
      In tennis, nearly every match for the belt is part of a tournament. (The exceptions to this are some events with round robin formats: Davis Cup, Laver Cup, and the opening portion of the year-end finals.) For large tournaments – the Grand Slams and bigger Masters 1000s – there is pretty much a guarantee the belt-holder will enter the tournament, and therefore the belt will funnel to the champion. The only way this doesn’t happen is due to some medical withdrawal before or during the tournament.

    <div class="faq-question">The Pete Sampras Problem</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      The belt started the 2002 US Open in the hands of (or around the waist of?) James Blake. Blake was then beaten by Lleyton Hewitt, who was in turn beaten by Andre Agassi in the semifinals. Agassi then faced longtime rival Pete Sampras in the championship. Famously, the 17th seed Sampras would go on to beat Agassi and win the tournament. Who did Sampras play next? He didn’t. He never played another ATP match. There’s the Pete Sampras Problem: he retired with the belt.
      <br><br>
      So how do we proceed? I will survey a few different options.
<br><br>
      1) Let Agassi keep the belt. This one is perhaps the easiest, but it definitely feels antithetical to the idea of the belt. He had the belt and he lost a match. By definition, he should no longer have the belt. But if he loses it, where does it go?
<br><br>
      2) Give the belt to the winner of the next tournament. Well, there were two tournaments running concurrently the following week, one in Lyon and one in Vienna. Seems unfair to choose between the two, and both were fairly small.
<br><br>
      3) Give the belt to the winner of the next big tournament. The next tournament of the Masters series (the largest behind Grand Slams at the time) was the Madrid Open. Coincidentally, this is the first tournament Andre Agassi plays after the US Open, and he wins it in a walkover. So this actually converges with option (1) immediately.
<br><br>
      4) Give it to the winner of the year-end finals in November, which was Lleyton Hewitt. This one seems fair, and Hewitt ended the year as number one in addition to winning the tournament, so he doubly earned it. However this method does have the downside that the belt disappears from September 2002 to January 2003.
<br><br>
      Ultimately, Andre Agassi will once again win the Australian Open in January of 2003, so no matter what path you choose for the belt, Agassi will certainly have it once again by the end of January. The question is where should it be from September 2002 until then? In the timeline, I opt to give it to Hewitt at the end of the 2002 year, so he starts the Australian Open in 2003 with the belt. Then it funnels back to Agassi, and we are back to where we were before the Sampras dilemma.
